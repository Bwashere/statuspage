# StatusPage-EJS
A simple status page with fair customization and automatic & manual server status detection.

**DISCLAIMER:** This was originally coded in PHP by [@Jekeltor#0001](https://jekeltor.com) and then reworked and slightly redesigned by [@Hyperz#0001](https://hyperz.dev/discord), [@Jordan#2139](https://jordan2139.me/), and [@FAXES#8655](https://faxes.zone/discord). We will hold no responsibility for breaks in the code, or misuse, also please note that nobody is required to help you set up this website.

**Documentation:** We offer a very basic EJS Website Setup documentation [here](https://docs.hyperz.dev/c/knowledgebase/ejs-website).
